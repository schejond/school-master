Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens
my father s family name being pirrip and my christian name philip my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than pip so i called myself pip and came to be called pip i give pirrip as my father s family name on the authority of his tombstone and my sister mrs joe gargery who married the blacksmith as i never saw my father or my mother and never saw any likeness of either of them for their days were long before the days of photographs my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones the shape of the letters on my father s gave me an odd idea that he was a square stout dark man with curly black hair from the character and turn of the inscription also georgiana wife of the above i drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly to five little stone lozenges each about a foot and a half long which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle i am indebted for a belief i religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers pockets and had never taken them out in this state of existence ours was the marsh country down by the river within as the river wound twenty miles of the sea my first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening at such a time i found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard and that philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above were dead and buried and that alexander bartholomew abraham tobias and roger infant children of the aforesaid were also dead and buried and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard intersected with dikes and mounds and gates with scattered cattle feeding on it was the marshes and that the low leaden line beyond was the river and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry was pip hold your noise cried a terrible voice as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch keep still you little devil or i ll cut your throat a fearful man all in coarse gray with a great iron on his leg a man with no hat and with broken shoes and with an old rag tied round his head a man who had been soaked in water and smothered in mud and lamed by stones and cut by flints and stung by nettles and torn by briars who limped and shivered and glared and growled and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin oh don t cut my throat sir i pleaded in terror pray don t do it sir tell us your name said the man quick pip sir once more said the man staring at me give it mouth pip pip sir show us where you live said the man pint out the place i pointed to where our village lay on the flat in shore among the alder trees and pollards a mile or more from the church the man after looking at me for a moment turned me upside down and emptied my pockets there was nothing in them but a piece of bread when the church came to itself for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me and i saw the steeple under my feet when the church came to itself i say i was seated on a high tombstone trembling while he ate the bread ravenously you young dog said the man licking his lips what fat cheeks you ha got i believe they were fat though i was at that time undersized for my years and not strong darn me if i couldn t eat em said the man with a threatening shake of his head and if i han t half a mind to t i earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn t and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me partly to keep myself upon it partly to keep myself from crying now lookee here said the man where s your mother there sir said i he started made a short run and stopped and looked over his shoulder there sir i timidly explained also georgiana that s my mother oh said he coming back and is that your father alonger your mother yes sir said i him too late of this parish ha he muttered then considering who d ye live with supposin you re kindly let to live which i han t made up my mind about my sister sir mrs joe gargery wife of joe gargery the blacksmith sir blacksmith eh said he and looked down at his leg after darkly looking at his leg and me several times he came closer to my tombstone took me by both arms and tilted me back as far as he could hold me so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine and mine looked most helplessly up into his now lookee here he said the question being whether you re to be let to live you know what a file is yes sir and you know what wittles is yes sir after each question he tilted me over a little more so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger you get me a file he tilted me again and you get me wittles he tilted me again you bring em both to me he tilted me again or i ll have your heart and liver out he tilted me again i was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that i clung to him with both hands and said if you would kindly please to let me keep upright sir perhaps i shouldn t be sick and perhaps i could attend more he gave me a most tremendous
