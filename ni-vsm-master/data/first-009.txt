The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson
story of the door mr utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile cold scanty and embarrassed in discourse backward in sentiment lean long dusty dreary and yet somehow lovable at friendly meetings and when the wine was to his taste something eminently human beaconed from his eye something indeed which never found its way into his talk but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after dinner face but more often and loudly in the acts of his life he was austere with himself drank gin when he was alone to mortify a taste for vintages and though he enjoyed the theatre had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years but he had an approved tolerance for others sometimes wondering almost with envy at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove i incline to cains heresy he used to say quaintly i let my brother go to the devil in his own way in this character it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men and to such as these so long as they came about his chambers he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour no doubt the feat was easy to mr utterson for he was undemonstrative at the best and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good nature it is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready made from the hands of opportunity and that was the lawyers way his friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest his affections like ivy were the growth of time they implied no aptness in the object hence no doubt the bond that united him to mr richard enfield his distant kinsman the well known man about town it was a nut to crack for many what these two could see in each other or what subject they could find in common it was reported by those who encountered them in their sunday walks that they said nothing looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend for all that the two men put the greatest store by these excursions counted them the chief jewel of each week and not only set aside occasions of pleasure but even resisted the calls of business that they might enjoy them uninterrupted it chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by street in a busy quarter of london the street was small and what is called quiet but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays the inhabitants were all doing well it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation like rows of smiling saleswomen even on sunday when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood like a fire in a forest and with its freshly painted shutters well polished brasses and general cleanliness and gaiety of note instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger two doors from one corner on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street it was two storeys high showed no window nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper and bore in every feature the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence the door which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker was blistered and distained tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels children kept shop upon the steps the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings and for close on a generation no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages mr enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by street but when they came abreast of the entry the former lifted up his cane and pointed did you ever remark that door he asked and when his companion had replied in the affirmative it is connected in my mind added he with a very odd story indeed said mr utterson with a slight change of voice and what was that well it was this way returned mr enfield i was coming home from some place at the end of the world about three oclock of a black winter morning and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps street after street and all the folks asleep street after street all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church till at last i got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman all at once i saw two figures one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street well sir the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner and then came the horrible part of the thing for the man trampled calmly over the childs body and left her screaming on the ground it sounds nothing to hear but it was hellish to see it wasnt like a man it was like some damned juggernaut i gave a few halloa took to my heels collared my gentleman and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child he was perfectly cool and made no resistance but gave me one look so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running the people who had turned out were the girls own family and pretty soon the
